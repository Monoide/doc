Sleep sort
==========

Someone proposed on 4chan the following sorting algorithm. At first glance, it
looks like it is a really efficient sort, as we can gain a constant equal to
the clock frequency, allowing to sort a list of any size with elements lower
than a few hundred thousands, in less than one second.

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   function f() {
       sleep "$1"
       echo "$1"
   }

   while [ -n "$1" ]
   do
       f "$1" &
       shift
   done
   wait

In fact, the work is given to the scheduler and it cannot be better than an
insertion sort.
