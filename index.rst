   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Aladin's documentation!
==================================

This is a personal documentation, stuff I do not want to forget.  It is
extraordinarily empty. I aim to fill it incrementally when I have time or when I
encounter something that I find well suited enough to fit in here.

It is sometimes in English, sometimes in French, with probably many mistakes.
