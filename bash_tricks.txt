Bash tricks
***********

A collection of Bash tricks that proved themselves to be useful

With `find`
===========

Afraid of `xargs`?
------------------

You want to do something with all file satisfying some regex... and don't
remeber how to use xargs ? Not a problem::

    find . -name stuff | while read f; do echo "$f"; done

Delete old stuff
----------------

Delete every file that is older than 7 days::

    find . -atime +7 -delete
