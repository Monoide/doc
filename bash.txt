A collection of Bash tricks that proved themselves to be useful

With ``find``
=============

find (1)
    search for files in a directory hierarchy
find (1p)
    find files
find (n)
    search for classes and objects


Afraid of `xargs`?
------------------

You want to do something with all file satisfying some regex... and don't
remeber how to use xargs ? Not a problem::

    find . -name stuff | while read f; do echo "$f"; done

Delete old stuff
----------------

Delete every file that is older than 7 days::

    find . -atime +7 -delete

With ``sed``
============

sed (1)
    stream editor for filtering and transforming text

Change accents for TeX::

    sed -i s/é/\\\'e/g file.tex
    sed -i s/è/\\\`e/g file.tex
    sed -i s/ê/\\\\^e/g file.tex
    sed -i s/à/\\\`a/g file.tex
    sed -i s/ç/\c\ c/g file.tex

With ``rsync``
==============

rsync (1)
    a fast, versatile, remote (and local) file-copying tool
rsyncd.conf (5)
    configuration file for rsync in daemon mode

.. _command-line-options:

-a, --archive
    archive mode
-v, --verbose
    verbose
-z, --compress
    compress file data during the transfer

My typical usage::

    rsync -avz FROM/ TO

With ``tar``
============

tar (1)
    an archiving utility


Uncompress::

     tar -xvf file.tar
     tar -xzvf file.tar.gz
     tar -xjvf file.tar.bz2
     tar -xYvf file.tar.lzma

Archive::

     tar -cvf file.tar folder1 [folder2...]

Compression::

     tar -czvf archive.tar.gz folder
     tar -cjvf archive.tar.bz2 folder


With ``fuser``
==============

fuser (1)
    identify processes using files or sockets
fuser (1p)
    list process IDs of all processes that have one or more files open

.. _command-line-options:

-a, --all
    Show  all  files specified on the command line.  By default, only
    files that are accessed by at least one process are shown.
-k, --kill
    Kill processes accessing the file.
-m NAME
    NAME  specifies  a  file on a mounted file system or a block device that is
    mounted.


Kill all process using ``file``::
